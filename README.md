Oral Microbiome Profiling and Machine Learning for OSCC Detection
This repository contains all the code, data outputs, visualizations, and results associated with a microbiome-based machine learning project aimed at identifying microbial biomarkers for early detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

üß™ Project Overview
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignancy with increasing incidence globally. Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis of the oral microbiome may play a significant role in OSCC onset and progression. This project analyzes 16S rRNA sequencing data from four publicly available studies in the NCBI SRA to identify microbial signatures distinguishing healthy individuals from those with OSCC. It uses QIIME 2 for microbial processing and Python-based machine learning models for classification and biomarker discovery.
